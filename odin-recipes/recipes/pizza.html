    <h3>Classic Cheese Pizza</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe will guide you through making a classic cheese pizza using your home oven.
        You will start by making your own pizza dough, following by the steps to prepare and cook
        your pizza using your home oven and a pizza stone or steel.  One hack will be using a 
        classic marinara sauce instead of having to cook your own pizza sauce from scratch.">
