# Odin Recipes

This folder is for the Recipes project that is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.  Although the course would have you set up a separate repo for this project, I am including it in my odin-project repo as I only want one repo for this entire course (although this is subject ot change if more complex projects seem to merit their own repos).  

The first part of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML.  Later on, this project will be revisited to add CSS styling.  My hope with this project is to build a cohesive website solely using HTML.
